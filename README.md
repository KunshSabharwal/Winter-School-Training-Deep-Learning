Welcome to my **Winter School Training on Deep Learning** repository! This intensive 5-day workshop was conducted by **Vivekananda Institute of Professional Studies ‚Äì Technical Campus**. I actively participated and explored deep learning concepts, hands-on coding, model building, and experimentation.

## üìñ About the Workshop

The training covered:

- Neural Networks & Deep Learning fundamentals
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for images
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTMs for sequences
- Transfer Learning & Pretrained Models
- Model evaluation, optimization, and deployment

Participants implemented real-world projects using **Python, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and OpenCV**.
